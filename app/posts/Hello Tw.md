# Hello Tw

This is my blog that I used about two days to build it on [Heroku][heroku]cloud
application platform.This blog system is based on the [revel][revel] which is very good
framework, so it saved me much time on building system.In fact, I just wrote a
small plugin. This plugin contain the article database and a article list.
Recently, I also added online-writing and live-update functions.If you are
interest in it, fork [totorow][src] on github.

The blog content could be anything.For example, source code analysis, random
thoughts in my life and so on...
